# Monorepo for the Jump Over Jump game
Play at [jumpoverjump.com](https://jumpoverjump.com/).

This repo contains implementations of the game in many languages for learning purposes:
 - `./c_sharp_phaser` (2014)
   - Playing with the game engine [phaser.io](https://phaser.io/).
 - `./c_sharp_angularjs` (2016)
    - Current implementation of the game at [jumpoverjump.com](https://jumpoverjump.com/) using C# on the backend and Angular.js on the frontend.
 - `./typescript_angular2_meteor` (2016)
   - Trying to better learn meteor, angular2 and typescript. The goal was to be able to only write typescript logic and be able to run it on front end and backend.
 - `./typescript` (2017)
    - `/core` Rewrite of the core logic using Typescript and functional programming (FP). The first game was built with angular.js + js using mostly Object-oriented programming (OOP).
    - `/ai` Basic and dumb ai to play with
    - `/terminal` Terminal interface to play the game
 - `bend` (2024)
